  "question": "What year saw the greatest capacity additions to energy storage systems?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Comparison\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A specific year with the highest deployment in gigawatts.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The deployment values for each country and category across all years.\n- The total deployment for each year.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the deployment values for each country and category for every year.\n2. Sum the deployment values for each year to find the total deployment.\n3. Compare the total deployments across all years to determine which year had the greatest capacity additions.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the total deployment is calculated correctly by summing up the individual values for each year.\n- Confirm that the year with the highest total deployment is identified accurately.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Use the legend to identify the countries and categories represented by different colors.\n- Read the deployment values from the top of each bar segment.\n- Focus on the \"Deployment in gigawatts\" axis to understand the scale of deployment.\n- Ensure that the comparison is based on the total deployment rather than individual country contributions.",
