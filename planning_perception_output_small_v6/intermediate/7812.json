  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Comparison\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A textual label indicating the age range with the highest proportion of people who say they \"Never\" read customer ratings or reviews when buying something for the first time.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The percentage values for each age group under the \"Never\" category.\n- The corresponding age ranges for each percentage.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the percentage values for the \"Never\" category across all age groups.\n   - U.S. adults: 16%\n   - Ages 18-29: 4%\n   - Ages 30-49: 8%\n   - Ages 50-64: 24%\n   - Ages 65+: 34%\n\n2. Compare these percentages to determine which age group has the highest percentage in the \"Never\" category.\n\n3. Identify the age range associated with this highest percentage.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the label corresponds to the age range with the highest percentage in the \"Never\" category.\n- Confirm that the answer is a textual label rather than a percentage.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Use the legend to understand the meaning of the different bar colors.\n- Read the percentages from the top of each bar in the \"Never\" category.\n- Focus on the \"Never\" category to compare the percentages across different age groups.",
