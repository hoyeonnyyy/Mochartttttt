  "question": "How many short tons of foreign cargo were handled in Houston in 2019?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the number of million tons of foreign cargo handled in Houston in 2019.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The blue bar corresponding to \"Houston, TX (C)\" under the \"Foreign\" category.\n- The exact value displayed next to the bar.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the blue bar labeled \"Houston, TX (C)\" in the chart.\n2. Read the value associated with this bar, which represents the amount of foreign cargo in million tons.\n3. Ensure the value is correctly interpreted as the number of million tons.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Confirm that the value read is indeed the amount of foreign cargo in million tons.\n- Verify that no other factors (like domestic cargo) are included in the total.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Use the legend to identify the blue color as representing \"Foreign.\"\n- Read the value directly from the chart, ensuring it corresponds to the \"Million tons\" scale on the x-axis.\n- Focus on the blue bar specifically for Houston, TX (C).",
