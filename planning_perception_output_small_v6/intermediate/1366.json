  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Calculation\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A single numerical value rounded to one decimal place.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The values in the green bars for \"More\" influence for each entity (U.S., EU, China).\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the values in the green bars for \"More\" influence:\n   - U.S.: 29%\n   - EU: 19%\n   - China: 17%\n\n2. Sum these values:\n   - 29% + 19% + 17% = 65%\n\n3. Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of entities (3):\n   - 65% / 3 \u2248 21.67%\n\n4. Round the result to one decimal place:\n   - 21.67% \u2248 21.7%\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the values used are from the green bars labeled \"More.\"\n- Confirm the arithmetic is correct and the rounding is applied accurately.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the green bars under the \"More\" category.\n- Read the percentages directly from the chart.\n- Use the arithmetic operations specified to calculate the average.",
