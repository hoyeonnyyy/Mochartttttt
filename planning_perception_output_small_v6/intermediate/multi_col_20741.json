  "initial_planning": "### Question Type: Data Extraction\n\n### Answer Expectation: A numeric value representing the number of Swedish companies operating on both the domestic and total markets over the specified period.\n\n### Critical Evidence Needed:\n- The chart shows the number of companies in the domestic market and the total market for each year from 2011 to 2018.\n- The relevant data points are the blue bars, which represent the domestic market.\n\n### Plan Steps:\n1. Identify the years from 2011 to 2018.\n2. For each year, locate the blue bar (domestic market).\n3. Record the number of companies shown by the height of the blue bar for each year.\n4. Sum up all the numbers obtained from the blue bars across the years.\n\n### Key Instructions for Image Analysis:\n- Use the legend to identify the blue bars as representing the domestic market.\n- Read the y-axis to understand the scale of the number of companies.\n- Ensure that the values are read directly from the chart without inferring or calculating them.\n\n### Answer Validation:\n- Verify that the sum of the domestic market values is calculated correctly.\n- Confirm that only the domestic market values are included in the sum.\n- Ensure no values are missed or double-counted.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe total number of Swedish companies operating on the domestic market between 2011 and 2018 is the sum of the values represented by the blue bars for each year.",
