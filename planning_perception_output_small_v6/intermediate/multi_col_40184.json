  "question": "What is the difference between most effective teaching format for teachers and least effective format for principals?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Comparison\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the difference in percentages between the most effective teaching format for teachers and the least effective format for principals.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The most effective teaching format for teachers (highest percentage for teachers).\n- The least effective format for principals (lowest percentage for principals).\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the highest percentage for teachers from the chart.\n   - The highest percentage for teachers is 65% for \"Professional conferences.\"\n2. Identify the lowest percentage for principals from the chart.\n   - The lowest percentage for principals is 23% for \"Participating in an online community of peers.\"\n3. Calculate the difference between these two percentages.\n   - Difference = 65% - 23% = 42%.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the difference is calculated correctly by subtracting the lower percentage from the higher percentage.\n- Confirm the result is a numeric value representing the difference in percentages.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Use the legend to distinguish between teachers and principals.\n- Read the percentages from the x-axis corresponding to the bars for each category.\n- Focus on the highest bar for teachers and the lowest bar for principals to identify the relevant percentages.",
