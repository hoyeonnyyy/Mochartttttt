  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the number of cars sold by Renault in Turkey in 2019, with units specified.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar corresponding to the year 2019 on the x-axis.\n- The height of the bar for 2019, which represents the number of units sold.\n- The y-axis label indicating the units sold.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the bar corresponding to the year 2019 on the x-axis.\n2. Read the height of the bar for 2019.\n3. Confirm the y-axis label to ensure the units are correctly interpreted (in this case, \"Units sold\").\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the bar is correctly identified for the year 2019.\n- Verify the height of the bar corresponds to the number of units sold.\n- Confirm the units are indeed \"Units sold\" as indicated on the y-axis.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the blue bars, as they represent Renault's sales.\n- Read the y-axis to understand the scale of units sold.\n- Ensure the bar for 2019 is accurately read and not confused with other years.",
