  "question": "How many times were the top 200 tracks on Spotify streamed in the UK in the week ending October 9, 2020?",
  "initial_planning": "### Question Type: Data Extraction\n\n### Answer Expectation: A numeric value representing the number of streams in millions.\n\n### Critical Evidence Needed:\n- The exact value at the end of the timeline, specifically for the week ending October 9, 2020.\n- The y-axis label indicating the number of streams in millions.\n\n### Plan Steps:\n1. **Identify the relevant data point**: Locate the data point corresponding to the week ending October 9, 2020, on the x-axis.\n2. **Read the value**: Observe the y-axis value associated with this data point.\n3. **Ensure the unit**: Confirm that the value is in millions as indicated by the y-axis label.\n\n### Answer Validation:\n- Ensure the value is read correctly from the chart.\n- Verify that the unit is indeed \"in millions.\"\n- Confirm there are no other axes or legends that might affect the interpretation.\n\n### Key Instructions for Image Analysis:\n- Focus on the x-axis to find the exact week ending date.\n- Pay attention to the y-axis to ensure the value is in millions.\n- No need to use the legend since the units are clearly labeled on the axes.",
