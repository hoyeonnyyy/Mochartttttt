  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the median age in years.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar corresponding to \"The Daily Show\" in the chart.\n- The number displayed at the end of the bar for \"The Daily Show.\"\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the bar labeled \"The Daily Show.\"\n2. Read the number at the end of the bar, which represents the median age of the viewers.\n3. Confirm that the number is indeed the median age by checking if it aligns with the context provided in the chart title and subtitle.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure that the number read is correctly associated with \"The Daily Show.\"\n- Verify that the number is indeed the median age and not another metric like mean age or a different category.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the horizontal bars and their corresponding labels.\n- Read the numbers at the ends of the bars to extract the median ages.\n- Confirm the context of the chart to ensure the correct interpretation of the data.",

  "refinement_1": "Sufficient: Yes\n\nChecklist Summary:\n- Answer Expectation Match: Pass\n- Evidence Completeness: Pass\n- Computation Verification: Pass\n- Logical Condition Handling: Pass\n- Answer Relevance & Specificity: Pass\n\nReasoning:\n1. **Answer Expectation Match**: The perception agent provided a numeric value (36), which matches the expected answer type (a numeric value representing the median age).\n2. **Evidence Completeness**: All critical evidence needed was explicitly found in the perception report. The bar corresponding to \"The Daily Show\" and the number at the end of the bar were correctly identified as 36.\n3. **Computation Verification**: No arithmetic calculations were required, so this step is not applicable here.\n4. **Logical Condition Handling**: There were no constraints or conditions that needed to be handled differently.\n5. **Answer Relevance & Specificity**: The \"Answer Candidate\" (36) directly addresses the question without any unrelated or vague text",
