  "question": "What is the global demand for primary energy in 2040?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the global demand for primary energy in 2040, with the appropriate units.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar corresponding to the year 2040 on the x-axis.\n- The height of the bar, which represents the demand in million metric tons of oil equivalent.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the bar corresponding to the year 2040 on the x-axis.\n2. Read the height of the bar, which is labeled with the value \"17,715\".\n3. Confirm that the units are \"million metric tons of oil equivalent\".\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure that the value read corresponds to the correct year (2040).\n- Verify that the units are indeed \"million metric tons of oil equivalent\".\n- Confirm there are no other bars or labels that could be mistaken for the 2040 value.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the x-axis to identify the years.\n- Use the y-axis to interpret the height of the bars in terms of demand.\n- Confirm the units by checking the label at the top of the y-axis.",

  "perception_iteration_1": "**Chart Overview:**\nThe chart is a bar graph showing the global demand for primary energy over different years, measured in million metric tons of oil equivalent. The x-axis represents the years, and the y-axis represents the demand in million metric tons of oil equivalent.\n\n**Key Visual/Text Details:**\n- The x-axis has the years 2000, 2017, 2025*, and 2040*\u5784\u65ad\u3002\n- The y-axis is labeled \"Demand in million metric tons of oil equivalent.\"\n- Each bar is blue and has a value at the top indicating the demand for each year.\n\n**Key Numeric Readings:**\n- The bar for 2040 is labeled with the value \"17,715.\"\n\n**Calculations / Comparisons:**\nNo calculations are necessary as the value is directly provided in the chart.\n\n**Answer Evidence:**\nThe bar corresponding to the year 2040 shows a demand of 17,715 million metric tons of oil equivalent.\n\n**Answer Candidate:**\n17,715 million metric tons of oil equivalent",
  "refinement_1": "Sufficient: Yes\n\nChecklist Summary:\n- Answer Expectation Match: Pass\n- Evidence Completeness: Pass\n- Computation Verification: Pass\n- Logical Condition Handling: Pass\n- Answer Relevance & Specificity: Pass\n\nReasoning:\n1. **Answer Expectation Match**: The perception agent's analysis provides a numeric value, which matches the expected answer type.\n2. **Evidence Completeness**: All critical evidence needed was explicitly found in the perception report. The bar for 2040 was identified, and its height was correctly interpreted as 17,715 million metric tons of oil equivalent.\n3. **Computation Verification**: No computations were required, so this step is not applicable.\n4. **Logical Condition Handling**: There were no logical conditions to handle in this case.\n5. **Answer Relevance & Specificity**: The answer candidate \"17,715 million metric tons of oil equivalent\" directly addresses the question without any unrelated or vague",
