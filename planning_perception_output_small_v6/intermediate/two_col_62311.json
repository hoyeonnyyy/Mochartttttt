  "question": "What is the unemployment rate projected to reach in 2022?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the unemployment rate in 2022, with no units or precision specified.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar corresponding to the year 2022.\n- The percentage value displayed on top of the bar for 2022.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the bar representing the year 2022.\n2. Read the percentage value displayed on top of the bar for 2022.\n3. Confirm that the value is indeed the unemployment rate by checking if it matches the context of the chart.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the value read is the percentage displayed on the bar for 2022.\n- Confirm that the value is not a GDP growth rate but rather an unemployment rate based on the chart's title and context.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the bar chart specifically.\n- Read the percentage values directly from the bars, as they represent the unemployment rates for each year.\n- Ignore any other elements in the chart that might distract from the main question.",

The chart actually shows GDP growth percentages, not unemployment rates.\n   \n2. **Evidence Completeness**: The perception agent correctly identified the percentage value for 2022, which is 9.8%.
