  "question": "What's the ratio of the smallest brown and largest yellow bar?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Calculation\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the ratio of the smallest brown bar to the largest yellow bar.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The smallest brown bar corresponds to \"Freedom Caucus Republicans\" in the \"10+ terms\" category.\n- The largest yellow bar corresponds to \"Other Republicans\" in the \"1-3 terms\" category.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the value of the smallest brown bar (Freedom Caucus Republicans in the \"10+ terms\" category).\n   - From the chart, this is 28%.\n2. Identify the value of the largest yellow bar (Other Republicans in the \"1-3 terms\" category).\n   - From the chart, this is 54%.\n3. Calculate the ratio by dividing the value of the smallest brown bar by the value of the largest yellow bar.\n   - Ratio = 28 / 54.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the values used are correctly identified from the chart.\n- Confirm the division operation is applied accurately.\n- The final answer should be a numeric value representing the ratio.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Use the legend to identify the color coding for \"Freedom Caucus Republicans\" (brown) and \"Other Republicans\" (yellow).\n- Read the percentages directly from the chart for accurate values.\n- Perform the division operation without rounding unless specified otherwise.",

  "refinement_1": "Sufficient: Yes\n\nChecklist Summary:\n- Answer Expectation Match: Pass\n- Evidence Completeness: Pass\n- Computation Verification: Pass\n- Logical Condition Handling: Pass\n- Answer Relevance & Specificity: Pass\n\nReasoning:\n1. **Answer Expectation Match**: The perception agent provided a numeric value, which matches the expected answer type.\n2. **Evidence Completeness**: All critical evidence needed was explicitly found in the perception report. The smallest brown bar (Freedom Caucus Republicans in the \"10+ terms\" category) is 28%, and the largest yellow bar (Other Republicans in the \"1-3 terms\" category) is 54%.\n3. **Computation Verification**: The division operation was correctly performed: 28 / 54 = 0.5185185185185185, which rounds to approximately 0.519.\n4. **Logical Condition Handling**:",
