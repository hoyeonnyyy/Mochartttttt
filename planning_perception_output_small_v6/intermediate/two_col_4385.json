  "question": "What was the net income of the Bank of America in dollars in 2020?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the net income in billion U.S. dollars for the year 2020.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar corresponding to the year 2020 on the x-axis.\n- The height of the bar for 2020, which is labeled with the net income value.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the bar corresponding to the year 2020 on the x-axis.\n2. Read the value at the top of the bar for 2020.\n3. Confirm that the value is in billion U.S. dollars.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure that the value read is indeed the net income for 2020.\n- Verify that the unit is correctly identified as billion U.S. dollars.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the x-axis to locate the year 2020.\n- Look at the y-axis to understand the scale in terms of billions of U.S. dollars.\n- Confirm that the bar for 2020 is correctly identified and read the value provided above it.",

  "refinement_1": "Sufficient: Yes\nChecklist Summary:\n- Answer Expectation Match: Pass\n- Evidence Completeness: Pass\n- Computation Verification: Pass\n- Logical Condition Handling: Pass\n- Answer Relevance & Specificity: Pass\n\nReasoning:\n1. **Answer Expectation Match**: The perception agent's analysis provides a numeric value, which matches the expected answer type of a numeric value representing the net income in billion U.S. dollars for the year 2020.\n2. **Evidence Completeness**: The perception agent explicitly found the bar corresponding to the year 2020 on the x-axis and read the value at the top of the bar, which is \"17.89\". This value is also confirmed to be in billion U.S. dollars.\n3. **Computation Verification**: No computations were required as the value is directly provided on the bar.\n4. **Logical Condition Handling**: There were no constraints or conditions that needed to be handled differently.",
