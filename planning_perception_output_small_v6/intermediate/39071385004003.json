  "question": "What is the timespan measured in the graph in years?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the number of years over which the data is measured.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The x-axis label indicating the years.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the x-axis label on the graph.\n2. Read the range of years from the x-axis label.\n3. Confirm the start and end years to determine the total timespan.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the identified years cover the entire range from 1989 to 2007.\n- Verify there are no missing years in the data series.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the x-axis to read the years.\n- Use the legend to identify the countries represented by different colors.\n- Ensure the y-axis is correctly interpreted as tonnes of ODS consumption.",
