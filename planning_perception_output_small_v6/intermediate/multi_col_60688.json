  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the percentage of respondents who use something \"Less often than daily.\"\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The red bars in the chart represent the category \"Less often than daily.\"\n- The percentages on each bar indicate the share of respondents for each category.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the red bars across all categories (AB, C1, C2, DE).\n2. Read the percentage values associated with the red bars.\n3. Compare the percentages to find the largest one.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the identified value is indeed the percentage and not a label.\n- Confirm that the comparison is done correctly by verifying the largest percentage among the red bars.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Use the legend to identify the red bars as \"Less often than daily.\"\n- Read the percentages from left to right for each category.\n- Focus on the red bars specifically to extract the required information.",

  "perception_iteration_1": "Chart Overview: The chart displays the frequency of usage of a product or service categorized into four groups (AB, C1, C2, DE). Each group has four segments representing different usage frequencies: more than 10 times a day, 2\u201310 times a day, once a day, and less often than daily. The red bars correspond to the \"Less often than daily\" category.\n\nKey Visual/Text Details:\n- The chart uses a horizontal stacked bar format.\n- The legend indicates the color coding for each usage frequency.\n- The x-axis represents the share of respondents.\n- The y-axis lists the groups AB, C1, C2, and DE.\n\nKey Numeric Readings:\n- AB: Less often than daily = 25%\n- C1: Less often than daily = 16%\n- C2: Less often than daily = 17%\n- DE: Less often than daily = 14%\n\nCalculations / Comparisons:\n- Compare the percentages of the red bars across all groups.\n- The highest percentage is 25% for the AB group.\n\nAnswer Evidence:\nThe largest value of the red bar is 25%.\n\nAnswer Candidate (for planner only, do not finalize): 25%",
  "refinement_1": "Sufficient: Yes\n\nChecklist Summary:\n- Answer Expectation Match: Pass\n- Evidence Completeness: Pass\n- Computation Verification: Pass\n- Logical Condition Handling: Pass\n- Answer Relevance & Specificity: Pass\n\nReasoning:\n1. **Answer Expectation Match**: The perception agent's answer (25%) matches the expected numeric value as per the initial plan.\n2. **Evidence Completeness**: All critical evidence needed (red bars' percentages for each group) is explicitly provided in the perception report.\n3. **Computation Verification**: The comparison and identification of the largest percentage were correctly performed, and the result (25%) is accurate.\n4. **Logical Condition Handling**: There were no constraints or conditions that needed to be handled differently.\n5. **Answer Relevance & Specificity**: The answer candidate (25%) directly addresses the question without any unrelated or vague text.\n\nSince all items in the checklist are marked Pass, the perception agent's report fully",
