  "initial_planning": "### Question Type: Calculation\n\n### Answer Expectation: A numeric value representing the difference between the shortest light blue bar and the tallest dark bar.\n\n### Critical Evidence Needed:\n- The shortest light blue bar's value in 2019.\n- The tallest dark bar's value in 2014.\n\n### Plan Steps:\n1. Identify the shortest light blue bar in the chart. It is the one in 2019 with a value of 90%.\n2. Identify the tallest dark bar in the chart. It is the one in 2014 with a value of 19%.\n3. Subtract the value of the tallest dark bar from the shortest light blue bar.\n\n### Answer Validation:\n- Ensure the subtraction operation is correctly applied.\n- Confirm the values used are from the correct years and bars.\n\n### Key Instructions for Image Analysis:\n- Use the legend to identify \"Cloud traffic\" as the light blue bars and \"Non-cloud traffic\" as the dark bars.\n- Read the percentages on the y-axis to determine the values for each bar.\n- Focus on the specific years mentioned in the question (2019 for the shortest light blue bar and 2014 for the tallest dark bar).",
