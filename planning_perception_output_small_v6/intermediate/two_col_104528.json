Identify the color red in the pie chart.\n2. Locate the label associated with the red section.\n3. Confirm the label is correctly identified and matches the red section.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the label is not a percentage but a category.\n- Verify the label corresponds to the red section in the chart.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Use the legend to identify the meaning of each color.\n- Read the labels next to each colored section in the pie chart.\n- Focus on the red section and its corresponding label.",
