Identify the revenue values for each year from the chart.\n   - 2013: 1,484 million euros\n   - 2014: 1,581 million euros\n   - 2015: 1,676 million euros\n   - 2016: 1,785 million euros\n   - 2017: 1,928 million euros\n   - 2018: 3,276 million euros\n   - 2019: 3,613 million euros\n   - 2020: 3,922 million euros\n2. Sum up all the revenue values.\n3. Divide the total sum by the number of years (8) to find the average.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the sum of the revenue values is calculated correctly.\n- Confirm the division by 8 is performed accurately.\n- Verify the final result is a numeric value without units or precision.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the bar heights corresponding to each year to extract the",
