  "question": "Which is the second largest bar value in the graph?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Comparison\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the percentage of wasted children in the second largest bar.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar chart showing the percentage of wasted children for each country.\n- The specific percentages for each country.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the countries listed on the y-axis.\n2. Compare the lengths of the bars to determine which one is the second longest.\n3. Read the percentage value associated with the second longest bar.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the percentage is correctly read from the bar corresponding to the second longest bar.\n- Confirm the percentage is not misread by checking the scale on the x-axis.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Use the legend to identify the color associated with each country.\n- Read the percentages from the top of each bar.\n- Focus on the relative lengths of the bars to determine the second largest.\n\nBy following these steps, the perception agent can accurately identify the second largest bar value in the graph.",

The percentage of wasted children is represented by the length of horizontal bars, with the color indicating the country.\n\nKey Visual/Text Details:\n- The title is \"Share of children who are wasted, 2010.\"\n- The x-axis represents the percentage of wasted children.\n- The y-axis lists the countries: Haiti, Libya, Morocco, Lebanon, and Colombia.\n- Each bar is colored differently to represent a specific country.\n- The percentages are written at the end of each bar.\n\nKey Numeric Readings:\n- Haiti: 6.12%\n- Libya: 5.32%\n- Morocco: 5.11%\n- Lebanon: 4.5%\n- Colombia: 1.45%\n\nCalculations / Comparisons:\n- Compare the lengths of the bars to determine the second longest.\n- The longest bar corresponds to Haiti (6.12%).\n- The second longest bar corresponds to Libya (5.32%).\n\nAnswer Evidence:\n- The second longest bar is Libya's bar.\n- The percentage value for Libya is 5.32%.\n\nAnswer Candidate (for planner only, do not finalize): 5.32%",
  "refinement_1": "Sufficient: Yes\n\nChecklist Summary:\n- Answer Expectation Match: Pass\n- Evidence Completeness: Pass\n- Computation Verification: Pass\n- Logical Condition Handling: Pass\n- Answer Relevance & Specificity: Pass\n\nReasoning:\n1. **Answer Expectation Match**: The perception agent provided a numeric value (5.32%) as the answer, which matches the expected answer type (a numeric value representing the percentage of wasted children in the second largest bar).\n2. **Evidence Completeness**: All critical evidence needed was explicitly found in the perception report. The percentages for each country were read from the top of each bar, and the relative lengths of the bars were compared to determine the second longest.\n3. **Computation Verification**: The computation was correctly identified that the second longest bar corresponds to Libya with a percentage of 5.32%. This was verified by comparing the lengths of the bars and reading the percentages from the top of each bar.\n4. **",
