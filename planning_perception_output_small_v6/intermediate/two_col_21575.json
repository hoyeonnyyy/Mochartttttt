  "question": "How much will the occupancy rate of hotels in Rome rise in 2019?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the occupancy rate in 2019.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The occupancy rate for the year 2019 on the bar chart.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the bar corresponding to the year 2019 on the x-axis.\n2. Read the percentage value at the top of the bar for 2019.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the value read is indeed the occupancy rate and not another metric.\n- Confirm the value is correctly associated with the year 2019.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the x-axis to locate the year 2019.\n- Look at the top of the bar for 2019 to extract the percentage value.\n- Verify the color of the bar matches the blue used consistently throughout the chart.",
