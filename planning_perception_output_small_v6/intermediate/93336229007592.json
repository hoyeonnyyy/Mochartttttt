  "question": "What is the average share of women with raised blood pressure in Malawi and Sri Lanka?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Calculation\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the average share of women with raised blood pressure in Malawi and Sri Lanka, expressed as a percentage.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The percentage values for Malawi and Sri Lanka from the chart.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the percentage values for Malawi and Sri Lanka from the chart.\n   - Malawi: 25.99%\n   - Sri Lanka: 19.36%\n\n2. Calculate the average of these two percentages.\n   - Average = (25.99% + 19.36%) / 2\n\n3. Provide the calculated average as the final answer.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the calculation is performed correctly by recomputing the average.\n- Confirm that the result is presented as a percentage.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Use the percentage values directly from the chart.\n- Focus on the horizontal bars corresponding to Malawi and Sri Lanka.\n- Ensure the values are read accurately from the chart's scale.",

  "perception_iteration_1": "Chart Overview: The chart displays the share of adult women aged 18 years and older with raised blood pressure in three countries: Malawi, Grenada, and Sri Lanka, for the year 1996. Raised blood pressure is defined as systolic BP \u2265140 mmHg or diastolic BP \u226590 mmHg.\n\nKey Visual/Text Details:\n- The chart uses horizontal bars to represent the share of women with raised blood pressure.\n- The source is the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC).\n\nKey Numeric Readings:\n- Malawi: 25.99%\n- Sri Lanka: 19.36%\n\nCalculations / Comparisons:\n- Average = (25.99% + 19.36%) / 2\n- Average = 45.35% / 2\n- Average = 22.675%\n\nAnswer Evidence:\n- The average share of women with raised blood pressure in Malawi and Sri Lanka is 22.675%.\n\nAnswer Candidate (for planner only, do not finalize): 22.675%",
  "refinement_1": "Sufficient: Yes\n\nChecklist Summary:\n- Answer Expectation Match: Pass\n- Evidence Completeness: Pass\n- Computation Verification: Pass\n- Logical Condition Handling: Pass\n- Answer Relevance & Specificity: Pass\n\nReasoning:\n1. **Answer Expectation Match**: The perception agent provided a numeric value as expected, which matches the answer expectation.\n2. **Evidence Completeness**: All critical evidence needed (percentage values for Malawi and Sri Lanka) was explicitly found in the perception report.\n3. **Computation Verification**: The calculation was explicitly computed and correct, resulting in an average of 22.675%.\n4. **Logical Condition Handling**: There were no constraints or conditions that needed handling.\n5. **Answer Relevance & Specificity**: The \"Answer Candidate\" directly addresses the question without any unrelated or vague text.\n\nFinal rule: Since all items are marked Pass, the perception agent's report is sufficient.",
