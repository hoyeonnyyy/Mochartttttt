  "question": "In what year did the number of reports for cannabis-related crimes peak?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A specific year as a textual label.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The height of each bar in the chart.\n- The corresponding year labels on the x-axis.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the tallest bar in the chart, as it represents the highest number of reports.\n2. Check the year label associated with this bar.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the identified year is correctly labeled on the x-axis.\n- Confirm there are no other bars taller than the one identified.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the x-axis to read the years.\n- Observe the height of each bar to determine which one is the tallest.\n- The y-axis shows the number of people, but this is not relevant for identifying the peak year.",
