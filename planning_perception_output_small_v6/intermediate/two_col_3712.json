  "question": "How many fewer migrant deaths were there from 2020 to 2021?",
  "initial_planning": "### Question Type: Calculation\n\n### Answer Expectation: Number of deaths (integer)\n\n### Critical Evidence Needed:\n- The number of migrant deaths in 2020\n- The number of migrant deaths in 2021\n\n### Plan Steps:\n1. Identify the number of migrant deaths in 2020 from the bar chart.\n   - The bar for 2020 shows 1,417 deaths.\n2. Identify the number of migrant deaths in 2021 from the bar chart.\n   - The bar for 2021 shows 827 deaths.\n3. Subtract the number of deaths in 2021 from the number of deaths in 2020 to find the difference.\n\n### Answer Validation:\n- Ensure the subtraction is performed correctly.\n- Confirm the result is an integer representing the number of deaths.\n\n### Key Instructions for Image Analysis:\n- Focus on the bars corresponding to 2020 and 2021.\n- Read the exact numbers from the top of each bar.\n- Ensure no other factors (like asterisks or additional notes) affect the interpretation of the data.",
