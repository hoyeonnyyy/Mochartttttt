  "question": "What was the number of similar trips by French residents to the UK in 2019?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the number of visits in millions, with no additional units or precision specified.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar corresponding to the year 2019 on the x-axis.\n- The height of the bar, which represents the number of visits in millions.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Locate the bar for the year 2019 on the x-axis.\n2. Read the height of the bar, which is labeled with the number of visits in millions.\n3. Confirm that the value is indeed in millions and does not require any further conversion.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure that the value read corresponds to the correct year (2019).\n- Verify that the value is in millions, as indicated by the y-axis label.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the x-axis to identify the year 2019.\n- Use the y-axis to interpret the height of the bar as the number of visits in millions.\n- Confirm that the chart uses consistent units across all bars.",
