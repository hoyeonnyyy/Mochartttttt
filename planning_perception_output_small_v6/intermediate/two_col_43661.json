  "question": "What was the value of aluminum that was recycled from scrap in the United States in 2017?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value with units (million U.S. dollars).\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar corresponding to \"Aluminum\" in the chart.\n- The value displayed at the end of the bar for \"Aluminum.\"\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the bar labeled \"Aluminum.\"\n2. Read the value at the end of the bar for \"Aluminum.\"\n3. Confirm the units associated with this value (million U.S. dollars).\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the value is read correctly from the bar.\n- Confirm the units are million U.S. dollars.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the horizontal axis to understand the scale.\n- The bars represent different materials, and their lengths correspond to the values in million U.S. dollars.\n- The value for \"Aluminum\" is clearly marked at the end of its respective bar.",
