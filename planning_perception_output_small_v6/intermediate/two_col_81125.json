  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A textual label representing the mode with the highest percentage.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The percentage values associated with each mode of transportation.\n- The corresponding labels for each mode.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify all the modes of transportation listed on the pie chart.\n2. Extract the percentage values next to each mode.\n3. Compare the percentages to determine which one is the highest.\n4. Identify the mode associated with the highest percentage.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure that the label corresponds to the mode with the highest percentage.\n- Verify that the percentage is correctly identified and not confused with another mode.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the labels and their corresponding percentages.\n- Use the legend to identify the colors associated with each mode if necessary.\n- Ensure that the percentages are read accurately from the chart.",
