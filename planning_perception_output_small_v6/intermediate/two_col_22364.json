  "question": "Which year has the highest sales?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A specific year label (e.g., \"2016\").\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The year labels on the x-axis.\n- The corresponding sales growth rates shown on the y-axis.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the year labels on the x-axis.\n2. Locate the highest point on the line graph.\n3. Determine the year associated with this highest point.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the selected year is indeed the one with the highest sales growth rate.\n- Confirm that the answer is a textual label rather than a percentage.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the x-axis for year labels.\n- Observe the y-axis for sales growth rates.\n- Note that the graph shows a descending trend, so the highest point will be at the beginning of the timeline.",
