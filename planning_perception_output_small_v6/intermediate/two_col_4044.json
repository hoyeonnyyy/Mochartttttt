  "question": "In what year did the number of drug-related deaths decrease?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Comparison\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A specific year where the number of drug-related deaths decreased.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The total number of deaths for each year on the x-axis.\n- The trend in the number of deaths over the years.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the total number of deaths for each year by reading the y-axis values corresponding to the bars.\n2. Compare the number of deaths between consecutive years to determine if there is a decrease.\n3. Note the year where the number of deaths decreased.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure that the identified year is based on a direct comparison of the total number of deaths between consecutive years.\n- Confirm that the decrease is not due to rounding or other factors affecting the data presentation.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the blue bars representing the total number of deaths.\n- Read the y-axis values to understand the scale of the data.\n- Compare the heights of the bars to identify trends in the number of deaths.",
