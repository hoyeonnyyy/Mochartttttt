  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Text Identification\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A textual label representing the country.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The label associated with the line in the graph.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the line in the graph that represents Switzerland.\n2. Read the label at the end of the line to determine the country it corresponds to.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the label matches \"Switzerland\" and not a percentage or other numerical value.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the line graph and identify the line corresponding to Switzerland.\n- Read the label at the end of the line to confirm the country.",
