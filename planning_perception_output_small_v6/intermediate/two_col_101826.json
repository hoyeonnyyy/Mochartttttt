  "initial_planning": "### Question Type: Calculation\n\n### Answer Expectation: A numeric ratio in the form of a fraction or decimal.\n\n### Critical Evidence Needed:\n- The percentage values for \"Companion animal\" (69%) and \"Aquatics\" (31%).\n- The ability to convert these percentages into a ratio.\n\n### Plan Steps:\n1. **Identify the Values**: \n   - Companion animal: 69%\n   - Aquatics: 31%\n\n2. **Convert Percentages to Ratios**:\n   - Companion animal ratio: 69/100\n   - Aquatics ratio: 31/100\n\n3. **Simplify the Ratio**:\n   - To find the simplest form of the ratio, divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD). However, since 69 and 31 are prime to each other, the ratio remains as 69:31.\n\n4. **Express as a Decimal**:\n   - Divide 69 by 31 to get the decimal ratio: 69 / 31 \u2248 2.2258\n\n### Answer Validation:\n- Ensure the conversion from percentages to ratios is accurate.\n- Confirm the GCD calculation for simplification.\n- Verify the division to get the decimal ratio.\n\n### Key Instructions for Image Analysis:\n- Use the legend to identify the categories (\"Companion animal\" and \"Aquatics\").\n- Read the percentages directly from",
