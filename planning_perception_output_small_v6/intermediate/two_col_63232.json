  "question": "What percentage of TikTok's U.S. audience had an income of $60k to $75k?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the percentage of TikTok's U.S. audience with an income of $60k to $75k.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar corresponding to the income range \"$60k-$75k\".\n- The percentage value displayed on top of this bar.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the bar in the chart that corresponds to the income range \"$60k-$75k\".\n2. Read the percentage value displayed on top of this bar.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure that the identified bar is correctly labeled as \"$60k-$75k\".\n- Confirm that the percentage value read is indeed the correct percentage for this income range.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the horizontal axis to locate the income range \"$60k-$75k\".\n- Look at the top of the bar corresponding to this income range to read the percentage value.\n- Verify that no other bars overlap or are mislabeled.",
