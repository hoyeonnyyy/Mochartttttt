  "question": "How many people in Australia graduated from medical school in 2017?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the number of graduates per 100,000 population in Australia in 2017.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar corresponding to Australia in the chart.\n- The value displayed on the bar for Australia.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Locate the bar for Australia in the chart.\n2. Read the value displayed on the bar for Australia.\n3. Confirm the value is in the correct units (graduates per 100,000 population).\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the value read is indeed the number of graduates per 100,000 population.\n- Verify there are no misinterpretations of the scale or units.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the bar for Australia.\n- Read the value directly from the bar, ensuring it aligns with the scale at the bottom of the chart.\n- Confirm the units are \"graduates per 100,000 population.\"",
