  "question": "What is the product of the largest value on light blue line and leftmost value on the dark blue line?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Calculation\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the product of the largest value on the light blue line and the leftmost value on the dark blue line.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The largest value on the light blue line.\n- The leftmost value on the dark blue line.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the largest value on the light blue line. This value is 65.\n2. Identify the leftmost value on the dark blue line. This value is 34.\n3. Multiply these two values together: \\( 65 \\times 34 \\).\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure that the largest value on the light blue line is correctly identified.\n- Ensure that the leftmost value on the dark blue line is correctly identified.\n- Perform the multiplication accurately to get the final product.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Use the legend to identify the light blue line as \"Control gun ownership\" and the dark blue line as \"Protect the right of Americans to own guns.\"\n- Read the values from the y-axis corresponding to the x-axis values for each line.\n- Focus on the x-axis to determine the leftmost point for the dark blue line and the largest point for the light blue line.",
