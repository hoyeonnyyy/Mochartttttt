  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A number representing the highest count of patients per million population.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar lengths corresponding to each diagnosis category.\n- The numerical values displayed on top of each bar.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify all the diagnoses listed on the y-axis.\n2. Compare the lengths of the bars visually to determine which one is the longest.\n3. Read the numerical value at the top of the longest bar to get the exact count.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the label corresponds to the diagnosis with the longest bar.\n- Confirm the value is a number and represents the count of patients per million population.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the y-axis labels and their corresponding bars.\n- Read the numerical values directly from the chart.\n- Ignore any other elements like the source information or additional icons.",
