  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the population in millions, with no additional units or precision specified.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The population value for the year 2019 on the bar corresponding to that year.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the bar corresponding to the year 2019 on the x-axis.\n2. Read the population value from the top of the bar for the year 2019.\n3. Ensure the value is in millions as indicated by the y-axis label \"Inhabitants in millions.\"\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Confirm that the value read is indeed the population for 2019 and is expressed in millions.\n- Verify that no other factors (like percentages or other units) are involved in the answer.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the bar chart, specifically the one labeled \"2019.\"\n- Read the exact number at the top of the bar for 2019.\n- Confirm the units are in millions, as indicated by the y-axis label.",
