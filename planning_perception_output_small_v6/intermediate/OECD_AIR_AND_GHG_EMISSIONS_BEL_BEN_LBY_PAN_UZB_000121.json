  "question": "How many countries have Air and GHG emissions rate of more than 8?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Counting\n\n**Answer Expectation:** Number of countries with Air and GHG emissions rate of more than 8.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- Identify the countries on the chart.\n- Determine the emissions rate for each country.\n- Check if the emissions rate is greater than 8.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the countries on the chart: Belgium, Libya, Uzbekistan, Panama, Benin.\n2. Read the emissions rate for each country:\n   - Belgium: The emissions rate is consistently above 10 throughout the period.\n   - Libya: The emissions rate fluctuates but remains below 8.\n   - Uzbekistan: The emissions rate fluctuates but remains below 8.\n   - Panama: The emissions rate is consistently below 2.\n   - Benin: The emissions rate is consistently below 2.\n3. Count the number of countries with an emissions rate greater than 8.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure that the emissions rates are correctly read from the chart.\n- Confirm that only Belgium has an emissions rate greater than 8.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Use the legend to identify the countries.\n- Read the emissions rates from the y-axis.\n- Focus on the time range from 1976 to 2004 for accurate comparison.",
