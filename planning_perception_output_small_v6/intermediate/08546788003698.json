  "question": "What is the value of India Bar?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value with units in tonnes.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar corresponding to \"India\" in the chart.\n- The value displayed at the end of the bar for \"India\".\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the bar labeled \"India\" in the chart.\n2. Read the value at the end of the bar for \"India\".\n3. Confirm the units associated with this value (tonnes per hectare).\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the value read is indeed the one at the end of the bar for \"India\".\n- Verify that the units are correctly identified as tonnes.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Use the legend to identify the color associated with \"India\".\n- Read the value from the right side of the bar, ensuring it corresponds to the \"India\" label.\n- Confirm the units are tonnes per hectare.",
