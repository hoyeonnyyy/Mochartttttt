  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the highest point on the graph.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The highest point on the graph for both \"More mudslinging\" and \"Less mudslinging.\"\n- The years corresponding to these points.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the highest point on the \"More mudslinging\" line.\n   - The highest point appears at 92% in the year 2016.\n2. Identify the highest point on the \"Less mudslinging\" line.\n   - The highest point appears at 4% in the year 2016.\n3. Compare the two highest points to determine the overall highest point on the graph.\n   - The highest point is 92%.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure that the highest point is correctly identified by comparing the values of both lines.\n- Confirm that the year associated with the highest point is 2016.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Use the legend to identify the lines for \"More mudslinging\" and \"Less mudslinging.\"\n- Read the values on the y-axis to determine the percentages.\n- Focus on the year 2016 for the highest point since it is the most recent data point shown.",
