  "question": "What was the value of U.S. semiconductor exports in 2019?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value with the unit \"billion U.S. dollars\" and precision to two decimal places.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar corresponding to the year 2019 on the x-axis.\n- The height of the bar, which represents the value of U.S. semiconductor exports in billion U.S. dollars.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Locate the bar for the year 2019 on the x-axis.\n2. Read the height of the bar, which corresponds to the value of U.S. semiconductor exports in billion U.S. dollars.\n3. Ensure the value is precise to two decimal places.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Confirm that the value read from the bar is indeed the correct value for 2019.\n- Verify that the units are correctly identified as \"billion U.S. dollars.\"\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the x-axis to identify the year 2019.\n- Use the y-axis to interpret the height of the bar in terms of the scale provided.\n- Ensure the value is read accurately from the bar graph.",
