  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Comparison\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the year with the highest average number of patients waiting for organ transplants.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The number of patients waiting for organ transplants in each category (Kidney, Liver, Lung, Heart, Pancreas) for the years 2017, 2018, and 2019.\n- The average number of patients for each category across the three years.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the number of patients waiting for organ transplants in each category for the years 2017, 2018, and 2019.\n   - Kidney: 685 (2017), 660 (2018), 670 (2019)\n   - Liver: 106 (2017), 98 (2018), 95 (2019)\n   - Lung: 90 (2017), 85 (2018), 69 (2019)\n   - Heart: 37 (2017), 37 (2018), 33 (2019)\n   - Pancreas: 18 (2017), 24 (2018), 27 (20",

The plan requires a numeric value representing the year with the highest average number of patients waiting for organ transplants.\n2. **Computation Verification**: The perception agent did not perform any computation to determine the average number of patients for each category across the three years. Instead, it directly stated \"2017\" without providing the calculation or evidence that supports this claim.\n3. **Answer Relevance & Specificity**: The answer \"2017\" does not directly address the question of which year recorded the highest average for the number of",
