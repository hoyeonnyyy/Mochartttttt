  "question": "Which year has the negative value?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A specific year label indicating the year with a negative value.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar chart showing percentage changes year-over-year (y-o-y).\n- The years on the x-axis.\n- The percentage values displayed on top of each bar.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the years on the x-axis.\n2. Look at the percentage values displayed on top of each bar.\n3. Determine which bar has a negative value by checking if the percentage is below zero.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the identified year corresponds to the bar with a negative percentage value.\n- Confirm that the percentage is indeed negative by checking the value against the y-axis.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the x-axis to identify the years.\n- Pay attention to the percentage values on top of each bar to determine their signs.\n- Use the y-axis to understand the scale of the percentages.",

  "refinement_1": "Sufficient: Yes\n\nChecklist Summary:\n- Answer Expectation Match: Pass\n- Evidence Completeness: Pass\n- Computation Verification: Pass\n- Logical Condition Handling: Pass\n- Answer Relevance & Specificity: Pass\n\nReasoning:\n1. **Answer Expectation Match**: The perception agent's answer \"2019\" matches the expected answer type of a text label.\n2. **Evidence Completeness**: The perception agent identified the year 2019 as having a negative value based on the percentage change displayed on the bar chart. This aligns with the critical evidence needed.\n3. **Computation Verification**: There was no arithmetic or ratio computation required; the perception agent correctly identified the year with a negative value by visually inspecting the bar chart.\n4. **Logical Condition Handling**: The condition of identifying the year with a negative value was correctly applied without any irrelevant constraints.\n5. **Answer Relevance & Specificity**: The answer \"2019",
