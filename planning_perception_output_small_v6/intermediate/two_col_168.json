  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value with units (in billion U.S. dollars).\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar corresponding to the year 2010 on the x-axis.\n- The height of the bar in relation to the y-axis, which represents military spending in billion U.S. dollars.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Locate the bar for the year 2010 on the x-axis.\n2. Observe the height of the bar and compare it to the y-axis to determine the exact value.\n3. Confirm the value is in billion U.S. dollars.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the value corresponds to the correct year (2010).\n- Verify the units are in billion U.S. dollars.\n- Confirm there are no misinterpretations of the scale or axis.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the blue bars representing military spending.\n- Read the y-axis to understand the scale of the values.\n- Pay attention to the x-axis to identify the specific year (2010).",
