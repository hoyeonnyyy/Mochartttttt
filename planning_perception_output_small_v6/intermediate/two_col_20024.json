  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the number of visitors in millions.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar corresponding to \"2020 pre-coronavirus\" with the label \"51.\"\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the bar labeled \"2020 pre-coronavirus.\"\n2. Read the value associated with this bar, which is 51.\n3. Confirm that the value represents the number of visitors in millions.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure that the value is correctly read from the bar and that it corresponds to the \"pre-coronavirus\" estimate.\n- Verify that the units are in millions.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the bar chart and the labels for accurate identification.\n- Ensure the correct year and category (\"pre-coronavirus\") are selected.\n- Confirm the units are in millions by checking the y-axis label.",
