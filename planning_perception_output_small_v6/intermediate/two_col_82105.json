Identify the bar in the chart that corresponds to the category \"Rarely or never.\"\n2. Read the percentage value associated with this bar.\n3. Confirm that the value is indeed the percentage of respondents who fall into this category.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure that the identified value is correctly associated with the \"Rarely or never\" category.\n- Verify that no other categories or percentages are misinterpreted.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the bar chart and read the percentage values directly from the chart.\n- The x-axis categorizes responses into \"Always, often or sometimes\" and \"Rarely or never.\"\n- The y-axis represents the percentage of respondents.\n- The blue bars represent the percentage of respondents for each category.",
