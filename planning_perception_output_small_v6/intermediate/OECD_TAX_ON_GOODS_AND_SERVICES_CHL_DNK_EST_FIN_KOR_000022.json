  "initial_planning": "### Question Type: Comparison\n\n### Answer Expectation: Boolean (True/False)\n\n### Critical Evidence Needed:\n- Median value of all the bars\n- Average of the leftmost and rightmost bars\n\n### Plan Steps:\n1. Identify the values of each bar:\n   - Korea: 8.1%\n   - Chile: 12.1%\n   - Estonia: 13.0%\n   - Finland: 14.2%\n   - Denmark: 15.6%\n\n2. Arrange these values in ascending order:\n   - 8.1% (Korea)\n   - 12.1% (Chile)\n   - 13.0% (Estonia)\n   - 14.2% (Finland)\n   - 15.6% (Denmark)\n\n3. Determine the median value:\n   - Since there are 5 values, the median is the third value in the ordered list: 13.0% (Estonia).\n\n4. Calculate the average of the leftmost and rightmost bars:\n   - Leftmost bar: 8.1% (Korea)\n   - Rightmost bar: 15.6% (Denmark)\n   - Average = (8.1% + 15.6%) / 2 = 23.7% / 2 = 11.85%\n\n5. Compare the median value with the",
