  "question": "In what year did Gazprom hold over 1.4 billion metric tons of crude oil reserves in Russia?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A specific year (numeric value) where Gazprom's crude oil reserves exceeded 1.4 billion metric tons.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The year on the x-axis where the bar reaches or exceeds 1,400 million metric tons.\n- The height of each bar corresponding to the year.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the y-axis scale to understand the metric used (million metric tons).\n2. Locate the bar that first surpasses 1,400 million metric tons.\n3. Read the corresponding year from the x-axis.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the identified year corresponds to a bar that is at least 1,400 million metric tons.\n- Confirm there are no other years with higher values.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the height of the bars to determine when they exceed 1,400 million metric tons.\n- The x-axis represents the years, and the y-axis represents the reserves in million metric tons.\n- No need to use the legend since the bars are consistently blue and the y-axis is labeled accordingly.",
