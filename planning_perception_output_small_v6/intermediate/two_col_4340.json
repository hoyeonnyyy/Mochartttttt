  "question": "What is the total percentage of people  who say that they do either less or more often than the usual amount of exercise during the coronavirus pandemic in the United States as of April 2020?",
  "initial_planning": "### Question Type: Calculation\n\n### Answer Expectation: A numeric value representing the total percentage of people who say they do either less or more often than the usual amount of exercise.\n\n### Critical Evidence Needed:\n- The percentages associated with \"Less often than usual\" and \"More often than usual.\"\n\n### Plan Steps:\n1. Identify the percentage of people who say they do \"Less often than usual.\"\n   - From the chart, this is 27%.\n2. Identify the percentage of people who say they do \"More often than usual.\"\n   - From the chart, this is 17%.\n3. Add these two percentages together to get the total percentage of people who say they do either less or more often than usual.\n\n### Answer Validation:\n- Ensure that the sum of the identified percentages equals the calculated total.\n- Confirm that the units are percentages and no other units are involved.\n\n### Key Instructions for Image Analysis:\n- Focus on the pie chart and the labels for \"Less often than usual\" and \"More often than usual.\"\n- Use the provided percentages directly from the chart without converting them into other units or performing additional calculations.",

Identify the percentage of people who say they do \"Less often than usual\": 27%\n2. Identify the percentage of people who say they do \"More often than usual\": 17%\n3. Add these two percentages together: 27% + 17% = 44%\n\n### Answer Evidence:\nThe total percentage of people who say they do either less or more often than the usual amount of exercise is 44%.\n\n### Answer Candidate:\n44%",
