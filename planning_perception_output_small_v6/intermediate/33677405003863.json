  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Calculation\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the average of the two smallest bars.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The values of the two smallest bars in the chart.\n- The ability to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition and division).\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the two smallest bars in the chart. These are \"Saint Lucia\" with a value of 0.36 and \"Qatar\" with a value of 0.11.\n2. Add the values of these two bars: \\(0.36 + 0.11 = 0.47\\).\n3. Divide the sum by 2 to find the average: \\(\\frac{0.47}{2} = 0.235\\).\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure that the values used for the calculation are correctly identified from the chart.\n- Confirm that the arithmetic operations are performed accurately.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the values associated with each bar.\n- Use the legend to identify the color coding if necessary but ensure the values are numerical.\n- Ensure the chart is read from left to right for the x-axis values.",
