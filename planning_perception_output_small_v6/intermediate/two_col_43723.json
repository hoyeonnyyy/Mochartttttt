  "question": "How many jobs were predicted to be created by travel and tourism in South Korea in 2028?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the number of jobs in millions, with no units or precision specified.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar corresponding to the year 2028 on the x-axis.\n- The height of the bar, which represents the contribution in million jobs.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the bar corresponding to the year 2028 on the x-axis.\n2. Read the value at the top of the bar, which indicates the contribution in million jobs.\n3. Confirm that the value is a numeric representation of the number of jobs.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure that the value read is indeed the number of jobs in millions.\n- Verify that there are no additional units or precision requirements.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the x-axis to locate the year 2028.\n- Look at the y-axis to understand the scale of the bars.\n- Pay attention to the value at the top of the bar for the year 2028.",

The x-axis represents the years, and the y-axis represents the contribution in million jobs. The bars are colored blue, and the values are labeled at the top of each bar.\n\n**Key Visual/Text Details:**\n- The x-axis includes the years 2012 to 2028.\n- The y-axis is labeled \"Contribution in million jobs.\"\n- Each bar has a value at the top indicating the contribution in million jobs.\n\n**Key Numeric Readings:**\n- The bar for 2028 has a value of 1.71 at the top.\n\n**Calculations / Comparisons:**\nNo calculations are necessary as the value is directly provided at the top of the bar for 2028.\n\n**Answer Evidence:**\nThe value at the top of the bar for 2028 is 1.71.\n\n**Answer Candidate:**\n1.71",
  "refinement_1": "Sufficient: Yes\n\nChecklist Summary:\n- Answer Expectation Match: Pass\n- Evidence Completeness: Pass\n- Computation Verification: Pass\n- Logical Condition Handling: Pass\n- Answer Relevance & Specificity: Pass\n\nReasoning:\n1. **Answer Expectation Match**: The perception agent's analysis provides a numeric value (1.71), which matches the expected answer type of a numeric value representing the number of jobs in millions.\n2. **Evidence Completeness**: The perception agent identified the bar corresponding to the year 2028 and read the value at the top of the bar, which is 1.71. This value is explicitly found in the perception report.\n3. **Computation Verification**: No calculations were required since the value is directly provided at the top of the bar for 2028.\n4. **Logical Condition Handling**: There were no constraints or conditions that needed to be handled differently.\n5. **Answer Relevance &",
