  "question": "What is the average of 1,3,5,7th bar in the chart?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Calculation\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the average of the specified bars.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The values of the 1st, 3rd, and 7th bars in the chart.\n- The units of measurement (thousand U.S. dollars).\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the values of the 1st, 3rd, and 7th bars in the chart.\n   - The 1st bar corresponds to the United States and represents the mean salary.\n   - The 3rd bar corresponds to Canada and also represents the mean salary.\n   - The 7th bar corresponds to Western Europe and represents the median salary.\n2. Sum the identified values.\n3. Divide the sum by the number of values (which is 3) to find the average.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the values used are correctly identified from the chart.\n- Confirm the units are consistent with thousand U.S. dollars.\n- Verify the arithmetic operation is correctly applied.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Use the legend to distinguish between \"Mean\" and \"Median.\"\n- Read the values from the y-axis, which represents \"Average salaries in thousand U.S. dollars.\"\n- Focus on the 1st, 3rd, and 7th bars to extract the necessary data points.",
