  "question": "When was the United Arab Emirates' gross domestic product first reported?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A specific year (numeric value) indicating when the GDP was first reported.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The x-axis label corresponding to the earliest year on the chart.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the earliest year on the x-axis of the chart.\n2. Confirm that this year is indeed the first year for which the GDP is reported in the dataset.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure that the identified year is the starting point of the dataset and not an extrapolated or estimated value.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the x-axis to identify the earliest year.\n- Confirm that the data starts at 1986, as indicated by the first data point on the graph.",

  "refinement_1": "Sufficient: Yes\n\nChecklist Summary:\n- Answer Expectation Match: Pass\n- Evidence Completeness: Pass\n- Computation Verification: Pass\n- Logical Condition Handling: Pass\n- Answer Relevance & Specificity: Pass\n\nReasoning:\n1. **Answer Expectation Match**: The perception agent's analysis provided a numeric value (1986), which matches the expected answer type (a specific year).\n2. **Evidence Completeness**: The perception agent explicitly found the first data point on the x-axis, which is labeled as 1986, confirming that this is the earliest year for which the GDP is reported.\n3. **Computation Verification**: No calculations were necessary, so this step is not applicable.\n4. **Logical Condition Handling**: There were no constraints or conditions that needed to be handled differently.\n5. **Answer Relevance & Specificity**: The answer candidate (1986) directly addresses the question without any unrelated or vague text.\n\nSince",
