  "question": "How much did the ticket sales for the Eiffel Tower in 2019 amount to?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the ticket sales amount for the Eiffel Tower in 2019, with the units \"in millions.\"\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar corresponding to the year 2019 on the x-axis.\n- The height of the bar for 2019, which is labeled with the value 87.2.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the bar for the year 2019 on the x-axis.\n2. Read the value at the top of the bar for 2019, which is 87.2.\n3. Confirm that the value represents ticket sales in millions by checking the y-axis label, which indicates \"Tu mover in millions.\"\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure that the value read is indeed the top of the bar for 2019.\n- Confirm that the units are correctly interpreted as \"in millions\" based on the y-axis label.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the bar chart, specifically the bar for 2019.\n- Read the value at the top of the bar for 2019.\n- Verify the units by checking the y-axis label.",
