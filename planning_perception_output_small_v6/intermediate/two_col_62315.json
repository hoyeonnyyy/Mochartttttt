  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the rental vacancy rate in Canada in 2020, with no units or precision specified.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar corresponding to the year 2020 on the x-axis.\n- The height of the bar, which represents the rental vacancy rate.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Locate the bar for the year 2020 on the x-axis.\n2. Read the height of the bar and identify the percentage value displayed at the top of the bar.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the value is read directly from the bar and not misinterpreted as a different year's value.\n- Confirm that the value is a percentage and not a decimal.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the x-axis to locate the year 2020.\n- Observe the y-axis to understand the scale of the percentages.\n- The bars are blue, and the percentages are written at the top of each bar.",
