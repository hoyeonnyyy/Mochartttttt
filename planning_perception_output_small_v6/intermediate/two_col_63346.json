  "question": "How many new scooters were registered in April 2020?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the number of new scooters registered in April 2020, with units specified as \"units sold.\"\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The exact bar corresponding to April 2020 on the x-axis.\n- The height of the bar in the y-axis, which represents the number of units sold.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Locate the x-axis and identify the bar corresponding to April 2020.\n2. Observe the height of the bar and read the value on the y-axis where it intersects with the bar.\n3. Confirm the units of measurement on the y-axis to ensure they match the expected units of \"units sold.\"\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the identified bar corresponds to April 2020.\n- Verify the height of the bar aligns with the units on the y-axis.\n- Confirm the value is a numeric quantity representing the number of units sold.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the x-axis to locate the specific month (April 2020).\n- Use the y-axis to read the numerical value at the top of the bar.\n- Confirm the units on the y-axis are \"Units sold\" to ensure the correct interpretation of the data.",
