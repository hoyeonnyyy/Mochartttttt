  "question": "What is the difference between the CPI between the months in which CPI was maximum and minimum?",
  "initial_planning": "### Question Type: Calculation\n\n### Answer Expectation: Number with units\n\n### Critical Evidence Needed:\n- The maximum CPI value on the graph.\n- The minimum CPI value on the graph.\n\n### Plan Steps:\n1. Identify the month with the highest CPI value on the graph.\n2. Identify the month with the lowest CPI value on the graph.\n3. Extract the exact numerical values for these two months.\n4. Subtract the minimum CPI value from the maximum CPI value to find the difference.\n\n### Key Instructions for Image Analysis:\n- Focus on the y-axis to read the CPI values accurately.\n- Ensure the x-axis is read correctly to match the CPI values with their corresponding months.\n- Confirm that the CPI values are in the format shown on the graph (e.g., 144.02, 145.6, etc.).\n\n### Answer Validation:\n- Verify that the extracted values are correctly matched to the respective months.\n- Ensure the subtraction operation is performed correctly to get the final difference.\n\n### Example Calculation:\n- Maximum CPI: May '21 = 151.25\n- Minimum CPI: May '20 = 144.02\n- Difference: 151.25 - 144.02 = 7.23\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe difference between the CPI in the months with the maximum and minimum values is **7.23**.",

The x-axis represents the months from May 2020 to May 2021, and the y-axis shows the CPI values ranging from approximately 144 to 152.\n\n### Key Visual/Text Details:\n- The CPI values are marked at specific points on the graph.\n- The CPI values increase over time, showing a general upward trend.\n- The CPI values are labeled on the graph, such as 144.02 for May '20 and 151.25 for May '21.\n\n### Key Numeric Readings:\n- The minimum CPI value is 144.02, occurring in May '20.\n- The maximum CPI value is 151.25, occurring in May '21.\n\n### Calculations / Comparisons:\n- Maximum CPI: 151.25\n- Minimum CPI: 144.02\n- Difference: 151.25 - 144.02 = 7.23\n\n### Answer Evidence:\n- The CPI values are clearly marked on the graph.\n- The difference between the maximum and minimum CPI values is calculated directly.\n\n### Answer Candidate:\nThe difference between the CPI in the months with the maximum and minimum values is **7.23**.",
