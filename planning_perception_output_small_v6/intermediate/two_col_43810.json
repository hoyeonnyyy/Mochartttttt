  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the fertility rate in Jordan in 2018, with no units or precision specified.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar corresponding to the year 2018 on the x-axis.\n- The height of the bar, which represents the number of born children per woman.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the bar for the year 2018 on the x-axis.\n2. Read the value at the top of the bar for 2018.\n3. Confirm that the value is the fertility rate in Jordan for that year.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure that the value read is indeed the fertility rate and not another metric.\n- Verify that the value corresponds to the year 2018.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the x-axis to locate the year 2018.\n- Look at the y-axis to understand the scale of the bars.\n- The color of the bars is blue, but this is not relevant to the answer since the question asks for a numeric value.",
