  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Calculation\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the ratio between the sales growth rates of alcohol-based hand sanitizers and face masks.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The sales growth rate for alcohol-based hand sanitizers (623%).\n- The sales growth rate for face masks (100%).\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the sales growth rate for alcohol-based hand sanitizers from the chart.\n2. Identify the sales growth rate for face masks from the chart.\n3. Divide the sales growth rate of alcohol-based hand sanitizers by the sales growth rate of face masks to find the ratio.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the division is performed correctly using the identified values.\n- Confirm the result is a numeric value representing the ratio.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the bar heights corresponding to \"Alcohol-based hand sanitizers\" and \"Face masks.\"\n- Read the percentages directly from the chart for accurate values.\n- Perform the division operation to obtain the final answer.",
