  "question": "What is the sum of highest value and lowest value of red bar?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Calculation\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the sum of the highest value and the lowest value of the red bar.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The highest value of the red bar in the \"Once a month or more\" category.\n- The lowest value of the red bar in the \"Once a week or more\" category.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the highest value of the red bar in the \"Once a month or more\" category. This value is 70%.\n2. Identify the lowest value of the red bar in the \"Once a week or more\" category. This value is 34%.\n3. Sum these two values: 70% + 34%.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure that the values used are correctly identified from the chart.\n- Confirm that the addition is performed accurately.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Use the legend to identify the red bar.\n- Read the percentages on the y-axis to determine the values.\n- Focus on the relevant categories (\"Once a month or more\" and \"Once a week or more\") for the red bar.",

  "refinement_1": "Sufficient: Yes\n\nChecklist Summary:\n- Answer Expectation Match: Pass\n- Evidence Completeness: Pass\n- Computation Verification: Pass\n- Logical Condition Handling: Pass\n- Answer Relevance & Specificity: Pass\n\nReasoning:\n1. **Answer Expectation Match**: The perception agent's answer candidate \"104\" is a numeric value, which matches the expected answer type.\n2. **Evidence Completeness**: The perception agent correctly identified the highest value of the red bar in the \"Once a month or more\" category as 70% and the lowest value of the red bar in the \"Once a week or more\" category as 34%. Both pieces of evidence were explicitly found in the perception report.\n3. **Computation Verification**: The perception agent explicitly computed the sum of 70% and 34%, resulting in 104. The calculation is correct.\n4. **Logical Condition Handling**: There were no constraints or conditions",
