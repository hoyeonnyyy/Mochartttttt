  "question": "What are the sum vale of Major, Minor, and Not a factor in an Athletic ability group?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Calculation\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the sum of \"Major,\" \"Minor,\" and \"Not a factor\" percentages for the \"Athletic ability\" group.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The \"Major factor\" value for \"Athletic ability.\"\n- The \"Minor factor\" value for \"Athletic ability.\"\n- The \"Not a factor\" value for \"Athletic ability.\"\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the \"Major factor\" value for \"Athletic ability.\" According to the chart, it is 8%.\n2. Identify the \"Minor factor\" value for \"Athletic ability.\" According to the chart, it is 34%.\n3. Identify the \"Not a factor\" value for \"Athletic ability.\" According to the chart, it is 57%.\n4. Sum these three values: 8% + 34% + 57%.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure that the sum is calculated correctly by adding the identified percentages.\n- Confirm that the sum does not include any other categories or values.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Use the legend to identify the color corresponding to each category (\"Major factor,\" \"Minor factor,\" \"Not a factor\").\n- Read the percentages directly from the chart for each category under the \"Athletic ability\" group.\n- Perform the addition operation to get the final sum.",
