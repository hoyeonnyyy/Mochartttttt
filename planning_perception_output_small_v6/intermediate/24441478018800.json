  "initial_planning": "### Question Type: Calculation\n### Answer Expectation: A numeric value representing the average share of wealth held by the top 1% in France and the United States in 1923.\n### Critical Evidence Needed:\n- The share of wealth held by the top 1% in France (48.53%)\n- The share of wealth held by the top 1% in the United States (35.34%)\n\n### Plan Steps:\n1. **Identify the relevant data points**: Extract the percentages for the top 1% wealth share in France and the United States from the chart.\n2. **Sum the values**: Add the two percentages together.\n3. **Calculate the average**: Divide the sum by 2 to find the average.\n\n### Answer Validation:\n- Ensure the sum of the percentages is accurate.\n- Confirm the division by 2 is correctly applied to find the average.\n- Verify the final result is presented as a single numeric value.\n\n### Key Instructions for Image Analysis:\n- Focus on the bar lengths corresponding to France and the United States.\n- Read the percentages directly from the chart.\n- Use the axis to ensure the correct interpretation of the values.",
