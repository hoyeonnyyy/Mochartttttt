  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the number of TEUs (Twenty-foot Equivalent Units) owned.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar labeled \"Owned\" in the chart.\n- The numerical value displayed next to the \"Owned\" bar.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the bar corresponding to \"Owned\" in the chart.\n2. Read the numerical value displayed next to this bar.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the value is correctly associated with the \"Owned\" category.\n- Confirm the units are TEUs.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the \"Owned\" bar and its corresponding numerical value.\n- The chart uses blue bars to represent different categories, so ensure the correct bar is selected.\n- The x-axis represents the number of TEUs, so the value should be interpreted in this context.",

  "perception_iteration_1": "Chart Overview: The chart displays three categories: Owned, Chartered, and Orderbook, represented by blue bars. The x-axis represents the number of TEUs (Twenty-foot Equivalent Units).\n\nKey Visual/Text Details:\n- The bar labeled \"Owned\" is the topmost bar.\n- The numerical value next to the \"Owned\" bar is 1,065,731.\n\nKey Numeric Readings:\n- Owned: 1,065,731 TEUs\n\nCalculations / Comparisons:\nNo calculations are necessary as the value is directly provided.\n\nAnswer Evidence:\nThe value 1,065,731 is clearly marked next to the \"Owned\" bar.\n\nAnswer Candidate (for planner only, do not finalize): 1,065,731 TEUs",
  "refinement_1": "Sufficient: Yes\n\nChecklist Summary:\n- Answer Expectation Match: Pass\n- Evidence Completeness: Pass\n- Computation Verification: Pass\n- Logical Condition Handling: Pass\n- Answer Relevance & Specificity: Pass\n\nReasoning:\n1. **Answer Expectation Match**: The perception agent's analysis provides a numeric value, which matches the expected answer type of a numeric value representing the number of TEUs owned.\n2. **Evidence Completeness**: All critical evidence needed was explicitly found in the perception report. The \"Owned\" bar and its corresponding numerical value of 1,065,731 were clearly identified.\n3. **Computation Verification**: No calculations were required, and the value was directly provided, ensuring correctness.\n4. **Logical Condition Handling**: There were no constraints or conditions that needed to be handled differently.\n5. **Answer Relevance & Specificity**: The answer candidate \"1,065,731 TEUs\" directly",
