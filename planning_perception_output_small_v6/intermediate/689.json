  "question": "What's the ratio(A:B) of dark and light green bars for bottom category?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Calculation\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A ratio expressed as a fraction (A:B)\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bottom category in the chart\n- The percentages for the dark green bar (Major threat)\n- The percentages for the light green bar (Minor threat)\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the bottom category in the chart, which is \"Large numbers of people moving from one country to another.\"\n2. Find the percentage for the dark green bar (Major threat) under this category.\n3. Find the percentage for the light green bar (Minor threat) under this category.\n4. Express the ratio of these two percentages as a fraction (A:B).\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the percentages used are from the correct category.\n- Confirm the calculation of the ratio is accurate by multiplying both sides of the fraction by 100 if necessary to avoid decimal values.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the bottom row of the chart.\n- Use the legend to identify the dark green and light green bars.\n- Read the percentages directly from the chart for the specified categories.",

  "perception_iteration_1": "Chart Overview: The chart displays the median percentage of people across 14 countries who consider various global threats to be major, minor, or not a threat.\n\nKey Visual/Text Details:\n- The chart lists different global threats with corresponding percentages for each threat level (Major threat, Minor threat, Not a threat).\n- The bottom category is \"Large numbers of people moving from one country to another.\"\n\nKey Numeric Readings:\n- For \"Large numbers of people moving from one country to another\":\n  - Major threat: 40%\n  - Minor threat: 40%\n\nCalculations / Comparisons:\n- To find the ratio of dark green (Major threat) to light green (Minor threat) for the bottom category:\n  - Ratio = 40% : 40%\n  - Simplify the ratio: 40/40 = 1:1\n\nAnswer Evidence:\n- The percentages for the bottom category are 40% for Major threat and 40% for Minor threat.\n\nAnswer Candidate (for planner only, do not finalize): 1:1",
  "refinement_1": "Sufficient: Yes\n\nChecklist Summary:\n- Answer Expectation Match: Pass\n- Evidence Completeness: Pass\n- Computation Verification: Pass\n- Logical Condition Handling: Pass\n- Answer Relevance & Specificity: Pass\n\nReasoning:\n1. **Answer Expectation Match**: The perception agent provided the answer as a ratio expressed as a fraction (A:B), which matches the expected answer format.\n2. **Evidence Completeness**: All critical evidence needed was explicitly found in the perception report. The percentages for the dark green (Major threat) and light green (Minor threat) bars were correctly identified and used.\n3. **Computation Verification**: The ratio calculation was explicitly computed and correct. The ratio of 40% : 40% simplifies to 1:1.\n4. **Logical Condition Handling**: There were no constraints that needed to be handled differently; the calculation followed the straightforward requirement of finding the ratio of the two percentages.\n5. **Answer Re",
