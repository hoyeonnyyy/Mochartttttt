  "question": "What is the difference between maximum values of International flight and Domestic flight?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Calculation\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value in kilowatt-hours (kWh) with no units or precision specified.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The maximum energy intensity value for International flights.\n- The maximum energy intensity value for Domestic flights.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the maximum energy intensity value for International flights, which is 1.68 kWh.\n2. Identify the maximum energy intensity value for Domestic flights, which is 1.57 kWh.\n3. Subtract the maximum value of Domestic flights from the maximum value of International flights to find the difference.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the subtraction operation is correctly applied.\n- Confirm the result is a numeric value in kWh.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the bar lengths corresponding to \"International flight\" and \"Domestic flight.\"\n- Use the kWh scale on the x-axis to read the exact values.\n- No need to use the legend since the colors are not relevant for this calculation.",

  "perception_iteration_1": "Chart Overview: The chart compares the energy intensity of transport per passenger-kilometer for international and domestic flights in 1960, measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh).\n\nKey Visual/Text Details:\n- The chart has two bars representing \"International flight\" and \"Domestic flight.\"\n- The energy intensity values are labeled as 1.68 kWh for International flight and 1.57 kWh for Domestic flight.\n- The x-axis represents the energy intensity in kWh.\n\nKey Numeric Readings:\n- Maximum value for International flight: 1.68 kWh\n- Maximum value for Domestic flight: 1.57 kWh\n\nCalculations / Comparisons:\n- Subtract the maximum value of Domestic flights from the maximum value of International flights: 1.68 kWh - 1.57 kWh = 0.11 kWh\n\nAnswer Evidence:\n- The difference between the maximum values of International flight and Domestic flight is 0.11 kWh.\n\nAnswer Candidate (for planner only, do not finalize): 0.11",
  "refinement_1": "Sufficient: Yes\n\nChecklist Summary:\n- Answer Expectation Match: Pass\n- Evidence Completeness: Pass\n- Computation Verification: Pass\n- Logical Condition Handling: Pass\n- Answer Relevance & Specificity: Pass\n\nReasoning:\n1. **Answer Expectation Match**: The perception agent provided a numeric value without units or precision, matching the expected answer format.\n2. **Evidence Completeness**: All critical evidence needed (maximum values for International and Domestic flights) was explicitly found in the perception report.\n3. **Computation Verification**: The subtraction operation was correctly applied, resulting in the difference being calculated as 0.11 kWh.\n4. **Logical Condition Handling**: The subtraction was performed based on the difference between the maximum values of International and Domestic flights, correctly applying the \"difference between\" condition.\n5. **Answer Relevance & Specificity**: The \"Answer Candidate\" directly addresses the question by providing the numeric value 0.11, which is the",
