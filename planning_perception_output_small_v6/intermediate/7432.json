  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Calculation\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the total percentage of students who either strongly agree or agree with the statement \"I like math.\"\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The percentages under the \"Strongly agree\" and \"Agree\" categories for the statement \"I like math.\"\n- The color coding for these categories (blue for \"Strongly agree\" and beige for \"Agree\").\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the percentage under \"Strongly agree\" for the statement \"I like math.\" This is 18%.\n2. Identify the percentage under \"Agree\" for the statement \"I like math.\" This is 46%.\n3. Add these two percentages together to get the total percentage of students who like math.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure that the percentages used in the calculation are correctly identified from the chart.\n- Confirm that the addition operation is applied accurately to the identified percentages.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the bar chart section related to the statement \"I like math.\"\n- Use the blue bar for \"Strongly agree\" and the beige bar for \"Agree.\"\n- Read the percentages directly from the chart without inferring or estimating values.",
