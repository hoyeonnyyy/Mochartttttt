  "question": "What is the average of all those who responded 'too little'?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Calculation\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the average percentage of respondents who said \"Too little.\"\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The percentages under each category labeled \"Too little\" in the chart.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the percentages under the \"Too little\" category for each environmental aspect listed in the chart.\n   - Protect water quality of lakes, rivers, and streams: 67%\n   - Protect air quality: 65%\n   - Reduce effects of climate change: 65%\n   - Protect animals and their habitats: 62%\n   - Protect open lands in national parks: 54%\n\n2. Sum these percentages.\n3. Divide the sum by the number of categories (5) to find the average.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the sum of percentages is calculated correctly.\n- Confirm the division by the number of categories results in an accurate average.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Use the legend to identify the \"Too little\" category (dark blue).\n- Read the percentages from the horizontal bars corresponding to each environmental aspect.\n- Focus on the numerical values rather than the color coding or other categories.",

  "refinement_1": "Sufficient: Yes\n\nChecklist Summary:\n- Answer Expectation Match: Pass\n- Evidence Completeness: Pass\n- Computation Verification: Pass\n- Logical Condition Handling: Pass\n- Answer Relevance & Specificity: Pass\n\nReasoning:\n1. **Answer Expectation Match**: The perception agent provided a numeric value (62.6%) which matches the expected answer type (a numeric value representing the average percentage of respondents who said \"Too little\").\n2. **Evidence Completeness**: All critical evidence needed was explicitly found in the perception report. The percentages under the \"Too little\" category were identified and summed correctly.\n3. **Computation Verification**: The calculation was explicitly computed and correct. The sum of percentages for \"Too little\" is 313, and dividing this by the number of categories (5) results in 62.6%.\n4. **Logical Condition Handling**: There were no constraints or conditions that needed to be handled differently.\n5.",
