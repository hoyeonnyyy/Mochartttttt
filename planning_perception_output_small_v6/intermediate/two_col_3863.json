  "question": "What is the average number of passenger movements(in thousands) in Hull and Dover ports in UK?",
  "initial_planning": "### Question Type: Calculation\n### Answer Expectation: Number + units (thousands)\n### Critical Evidence Needed:\n- Passenger movements in thousands for Hull port\n- Passenger movements in thousands for Dover port\n\n### Plan Steps:\n1. Identify the passenger movements in thousands for Hull port from the chart.\n   - The bar corresponding to Hull shows 827 thousand passengers.\n2. Identify the passenger movements in thousands for Dover port from the chart.\n   - The bar corresponding to Dover shows 10,901 thousand passengers.\n3. Calculate the average by summing the two values and dividing by 2.\n   - Average = (827 + 10,901) / 2\n4. Provide the result with the appropriate units.\n\n### Answer Validation:\n- Ensure the sum of the values is accurate.\n- Confirm the division by 2 is correctly applied.\n- Verify the final result is expressed in thousands.\n\n### Key Instructions for Image Analysis:\n- Focus on the bars representing Hull and Dover ports.\n- Read the values directly from the chart, ensuring they are in thousands.\n- Use the x-axis to confirm the scale is in thousands.",
