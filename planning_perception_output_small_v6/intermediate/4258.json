  "question": "What's the sum of median value of blue and green graph?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Calculation\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the sum of the median values of the blue and green graphs.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The median value of the blue graph (China's military strength).\n- The median value of the green graph (China's economic strength).\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the median value of the blue graph (China's military strength) by finding the middle value in the sequence of percentages for the blue line.\n   - The values for the blue graph are: 28%, 37%, 36%, 29%.\n   - The median is the average of the second and third values: (37% + 36%) / 2 = 36.5%.\n\n2. Identify the median value of the green graph (China's economic strength) by finding the middle value in the sequence of percentages for the green line.\n   - The values for the green graph are: 59%, 50%, 52%, 58%.\n   - The median is the average of the second and third values: (50% + 52%) / 2 = 51%.\n\n3. Sum the two median values identified in steps 1 and 2.\n   - Median of blue graph: 36.5%\n   - Median of green graph: 51%\n   - Sum: 36.5% + 5",
