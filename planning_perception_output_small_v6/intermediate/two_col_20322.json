  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A specific year as a textual label.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The year with the highest GDP value on the y-axis.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the highest point on the line graph.\n2. Determine the corresponding year on the x-axis for that point.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the identified year is the one with the highest GDP value by visually inspecting the graph.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the y-axis to read the GDP values accurately.\n- Pay attention to the x-axis to identify the corresponding years.\n- Confirm the highest point visually before selecting the year.",
