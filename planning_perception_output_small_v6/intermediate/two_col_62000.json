  "question": "How many Mercedes-Benz cars were registered in Poland in 2011?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the number of Mercedes-Benz cars registered in Poland in 2011, with no units or precision specified.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar corresponding to the year 2011 on the x-axis.\n- The height of the bar for 2011, which is labeled with the number of units.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the bar corresponding to the year 2011 on the x-axis.\n2. Read the value at the top of the bar for 2011.\n3. Confirm that the value represents the number of units (cars) registered in Poland in 2011.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure that the value read corresponds to the number of units (cars).\n- Verify that the value is indeed the one associated with the year 2011.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the x-axis to identify the year 2011.\n- Look at the y-axis to understand the scale of the bars.\n- Pay attention to the labels at the top of each bar to ensure they represent the number of units (cars).",
