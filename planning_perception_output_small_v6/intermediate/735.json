  "question": "Add both bars in Rep/Lean Rep category, divide it by 2, what's the result?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Calculation\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the average of the two percentages in the \"Rep/Lean Rep\" category.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The percentages for \"No significant changes are needed\" (57%)\n- The percentages for \"Significant changes are needed\" (41%)\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the percentages for each subcategory under \"Rep/Lean Rep.\"\n   - \"No significant changes are needed\": 57%\n   - \"Significant changes are needed\": 41%\n2. Add these two percentages together.\n3. Divide the sum by 2 to find the average.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the percentages used are correctly identified from the chart.\n- Confirm the addition and division are performed accurately.\n- Verify the final result is a single numeric value.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Use the legend to identify the color coding for \"No significant changes are needed\" and \"Significant changes are needed.\"\n- Read the percentages directly from the chart for accurate calculation.\n- Remember to use the provided percentages without converting them into other units or ratios.",
