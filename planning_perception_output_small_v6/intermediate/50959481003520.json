  "question": "Is the median of China in the graph greater than the median of the Angola graph?",
  "initial_planning": "### Question Type: Comparison\n\n### Answer Expectation: Yes/No\n\n### Critical Evidence Needed:\n- The median value for China's clean cooking fuel access over the given time range.\n- The median value for Angola's clean cooking fuel access over the given time range.\n\n### Plan Steps:\n1. Identify the median value for China's clean cooking fuel access from the graph.\n   - Locate the data points for China on the graph.\n   - Determine the middle value(s) when the data points are ordered by year.\n   - If there is an even number of data points, take the average of the two middle values.\n   \n2. Identify the median value for Angola's clean cooking fuel access from the graph.\n   - Locate the data points for Angola on the graph.\n   - Determine the middle value(s) when the data points are ordered by year.\n   - If there is an even number of data points, take the average of the two middle values.\n   \n3. Compare the two median values obtained from steps 1 and 2.\n   - If the median value for China is greater than the median value for Angola, the answer is \"Yes.\"\n   - If the median value for China is less than or equal to the median value for Angola, the answer is \"No.\"\n\n### Answer Validation:\n- Ensure that the median values are correctly identified by checking the exact data points and their ordering.\n- Confirm that the comparison is made between the two countries' medians, not their overall",
