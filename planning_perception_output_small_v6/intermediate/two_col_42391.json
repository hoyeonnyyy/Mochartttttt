  "question": "What was the weighted index of social justice in Germany in 2011?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the weighted index of social justice in Germany in 2011.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar corresponding to Germany in the chart.\n- The exact value displayed on the bar for Germany.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Locate the bar labeled \"Germany\" in the chart.\n2. Read the numerical value associated with the bar for Germany.\n3. Ensure the value is the weighted index of social justice and not another metric.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Confirm that the value read corresponds to the weighted index of social justice.\n- Verify that no other metric is being displayed for Germany.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the horizontal axis to understand the scale and the position of each country's bar.\n- Pay attention to the numerical labels at the end of each bar to extract the precise value.\n- Ensure the chart is set to display the weighted index of social justice specifically, as this is the metric being asked for.",

  "perception_iteration_1": "**Chart Overview:**\nThe chart displays the weighted index of social justice for various countries in 2011. The bars represent different countries, and their lengths correspond to the index values. The x-axis represents the index value, ranging from 0 to 10.\n\n**Key Visual/Text Details:**\n- The chart includes a legend indicating the index value for each country.\n- The index values are clearly marked at the end of each bar.\n- The OECD Total is also included in the chart, showing an index value of 6.55.\n\n**Key Numeric Readings:**\n- The bar for Germany is located near the middle of the chart.\n- The index value for Germany is clearly marked at the end of the bar.\n\n**Calculations / Comparisons:**\nNo calculations are necessary as the index value for Germany is directly provided in the chart.\n\n**Answer Evidence:**\nThe index value for Germany is 6.89.\n\n**Answer Candidate:**\n6.89",
  "refinement_1": "Sufficient: Yes\n\nChecklist Summary:\n- Answer Expectation Match: Pass\n- Evidence Completeness: Pass\n- Computation Verification: Pass\n- Logical Condition Handling: Pass\n- Answer Relevance & Specificity: Pass\n\nReasoning:\n1. **Answer Expectation Match**: The perception agent provided a numeric value, which matches the expected answer type.\n2. **Evidence Completeness**: All critical evidence needed was explicitly found in the perception report. The bar for Germany was identified, and its index value was clearly marked as 6.89.\n3. **Computation Verification**: No computations were required, so this step is not applicable.\n4. **Logical Condition Handling**: There were no constraints or conditions that needed to be handled.\n5. **Answer Relevance & Specificity**: The answer candidate, 6.89, directly addresses the question without any unrelated or vague text.\n\nSince all items in the checklist are marked Pass, the perception agent's analysis fully satisfies",
