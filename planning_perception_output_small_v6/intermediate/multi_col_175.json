  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Comparison\n\n**Answer Expectation:** Yes/No\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The black bars representing \"Industry\" across all years from 2009 to 2019.\n- The percentage values associated with each year's black bar.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the black bars corresponding to \"Industry\" in the chart.\n2. Read the percentage values for each year from 2009 to 2019.\n3. Compare these values to determine if they are sorted increasingly from left to right.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure that the percentages are read correctly from the chart.\n- Confirm that the values are indeed increasing from left to right.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Use the legend to identify the black bars as \"Industry.\"\n- Read the percentage values from the top of each black bar.\n- Compare the values to check for an increasing trend.",
