  "question": "What is the difference between the highest and the second highest point?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Calculation\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the difference between the highest and the second highest points on the graph.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The highest point on the graph.\n- The second highest point on the graph.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the highest point on the graph by locating the maximum value on the y-axis.\n   - The highest point appears to be at 83.29% in 2026.\n2. Identify the second highest point on the graph by locating the next highest value before the highest point.\n   - The second highest point appears to be at 80.42% in 2024.\n3. Subtract the second highest point from the highest point to find the difference.\n   - Difference = 83.29% - 80.42%\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure that the identified points are correctly labeled and not misread.\n- Confirm that the subtraction operation is performed accurately to get the final difference.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the y-axis to read the percentages accurately.\n- Ensure that the points are identified based on their exact values rather than approximate positions on the graph.",
