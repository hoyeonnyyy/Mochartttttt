  "initial_planning": "### Question Type: Calculation\n### Answer Expectation: Number with units (years)\n### Critical Evidence Needed:\n- Minimum male life expectancy in 2009\n- Median female life expectancy across all years\n\n### Plan Steps:\n1. Identify the minimum male life expectancy from the chart. This is the starting point for the calculation.\n2. Determine the median female life expectancy by finding the middle value when all female life expectancies are listed in ascending order.\n3. Subtract the minimum male life expectancy from the median female life expectancy.\n\n### Key Instructions for Image Analysis:\n- Use the legend to identify the blue line as representing female life expectancy and the black line as representing male life expectancy.\n- Read the y-axis values corresponding to each year on the x-axis.\n- The median female life expectancy will be the middle value when all the female life expectancy values are arranged in ascending order.\n\n### Answer Validation:\n- Ensure the minimum male life expectancy is correctly identified.\n- Confirm the median female life expectancy is calculated accurately.\n- Verify the subtraction operation is performed correctly.\n\n### Execution:\n1. Minimum male life expectancy in 2009: 69.01 years\n2. List all female life expectancies in ascending order: 74.29, 74.74, 75.22, 75.68, 76.13, 76.54, 76.9, 77",
