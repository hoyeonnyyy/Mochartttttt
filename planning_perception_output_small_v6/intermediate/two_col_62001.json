  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Data Extraction\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A numeric value representing the number of Saab cars sold in Sweden in 2008, with units specified.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar corresponding to the year 2008 on the x-axis.\n- The height of the bar for 2008 on the y-axis, which represents \"Units sold.\"\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the bar corresponding to the year 2008 on the x-axis.\n2. Read the height of the bar for 2008 on the y-axis.\n3. Confirm the units of measurement on the y-axis to ensure they match the expected answer format.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the identified bar is correctly associated with the year 2008.\n- Verify that the height of the bar corresponds to the number of units sold, not percentages or other metrics.\n- Confirm the units of measurement are consistent with the expected answer format.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the blue bars representing the number of units sold.\n- Read the y-axis to understand the scale of units sold.\n- Ensure the x-axis correctly labels the years, specifically focusing on 2008.",
