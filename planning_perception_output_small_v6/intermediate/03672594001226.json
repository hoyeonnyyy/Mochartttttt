  "question": "Which country has the highest installed geothermal energy capacity according to the given graph?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Comparison\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A textual label indicating the country with the highest installed geothermal energy capacity in megawatts (MW).\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar lengths corresponding to North America, the Philippines, and Croatia.\n- The numerical values provided next to each bar.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the countries listed on the y-axis: North America, Philippines, and Croatia.\n2. Compare the lengths of the bars for each country.\n3. Note the numerical values next to each bar to confirm the exact capacity.\n4. Determine which country has the longest bar and the highest numerical value.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure the label is the name of the country, not a numerical value.\n- Confirm the units are MW.\n- Verify the comparison is based on the cumulative installed capacity.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the bar lengths and their corresponding labels.\n- Read the numerical values next to each bar for precise comparison.\n- Use the x-axis to understand the scale of the values.",
