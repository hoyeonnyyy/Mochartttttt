  "question": "In how many years the percentage of workforce in the Agriculture sector exceeded 45%?",
  "initial_planning": "### Question Type: Counting\n\n### Answer Expectation: Number of years\n\n### Critical Evidence Needed:\n- The percentage of the workforce in the Agriculture sector for each year from 2010 to 2020.\n- The threshold of 45%.\n\n### Plan Steps:\n1. **Identify the relevant data**: Look at the blue portion of each bar, which represents the percentage of the workforce in the Agriculture sector for each year.\n2. **Compare with the threshold**: Check if the percentage for each year is greater than 45%.\n3. **Count the occurrences**: Keep a count of the years where the percentage exceeds 45%.\n\n### Key Instructions for Image Analysis:\n- Use the legend to identify the blue section as representing the Agriculture sector.\n- Read the percentages from the top of each bar.\n- Ensure to compare the percentages with 45% rather than the total workforce percentage.\n\n### Answer Validation:\n- Verify that the count is based on the percentage of the workforce in the Agriculture sector, not the total workforce.\n- Confirm that the count includes only the years where the percentage exceeds 45%.",

The critical evidence (percentage values for each year) is present in the report.\n\n3. **Computation Verification**: \n   - The perception agent explicitly compared each percentage with 45% and counted the years where the percentage exceeded this threshold. The computation appears correct.\n\n4. **Logical Condition Handling**: \n   - The condition \"exceeded 45%\" was correctly applied, and no other conditions were present.\n\n5. **Answer Relevance & Specificity**: \n   - The answer candidate \"The percentage of the workforce in the Agriculture sector exceeded 45% in 2 years\" directly addresses the question without any unrelated text.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- All",
