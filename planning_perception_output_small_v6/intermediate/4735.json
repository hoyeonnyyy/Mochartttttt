  "question": "How many games in the chart have over 40 ratings?",
  "initial_planning": "**Question Type:** Counting\n\n**Answer Expectation:** A number indicating how many games have over 40 ratings.\n\n**Critical Evidence Needed:**\n- The bar lengths corresponding to each game type.\n- The numerical values displayed on top of each bar.\n\n**Plan Steps:**\n1. Identify the game types listed on the y-axis.\n2. Compare the numerical values at the top of each bar with the threshold of 40.\n3. Count the number of bars where the value is greater than 40.\n\n**Answer Validation:**\n- Ensure that the count is based on the numerical values rather than the bar lengths.\n- Verify that only games with values above 40 are included in the count.\n\n**Key Instructions for Image Analysis:**\n- Focus on the numerical values at the top of each bar.\n- Ignore the bar lengths and focus on the numerical data provided.\n- Confirm that the threshold is 40 and not a percentage or any other unit.",

  "refinement_1": "Sufficient: Yes\n\nChecklist Summary:\n- Answer Expectation Match: [Pass]\n- Evidence Completeness: [Pass]\n- Computation Verification: [Pass]\n- Logical Condition Handling: [Pass]\n- Answer Relevance & Specificity: [Pass]\n\nReasoning:\n1. **Answer Expectation Match**: The perception agent's answer \"4\" matches the expected numeric value as per the initial plan.\n2. **Evidence Completeness**: The perception agent considered the numerical values at the top of each bar, which were explicitly provided in the image.\n3. **Computation Verification**: The computation was correctly verified by counting the number of bars with values over 40. The perception agent identified four games meeting this criterion.\n4. **Logical Condition Handling**: The condition \"over 40 ratings\" was correctly applied without any errors.\n5. **Answer Relevance & Specificity**: The answer \"4\" directly addresses the question without any unrelated or vague text.\n\nSince all items in",
